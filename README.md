# Plotter

This is a script that plots chromatogram curves (for now). First you get prompted for a `.csv` file as input to plot.

## Log

20230921 - First working iteration after battling with Unicorn to obtain the data in an appropriate format.

20231220 - Made a new version for Ã„kta Xpress, because data is exported slightly differently (not as a `.csv`, best option is `.xls`). It can also plot fractions, but without labels.
